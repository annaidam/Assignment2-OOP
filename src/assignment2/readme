A2 Group 51 – Anna Mäkinen & Oana Isabela Mitac

We started the group as three and divided the tasks 1–6 like this:
Anna: tasks 2 & 4
Isabela: tasks 3 & 5
Third member: tasks 1 & 6.

After the teamwork with the third member didn't workout we also did the tasks 1 & 6 together as two.
Everything after that we did together.
