    /*Each pokemon has a name, a maximum health points (MAX HP), energy points (EP), a
    single skill (Task 2), and a type.

    A pokemon can be one of four types: Fire, Water, Grass and
    Normal. When created, the EP always starts at 100, and the pokemon does not know any
    skill. On the other hand, the name, MAX HP and type must be specified.

    Pokemon also have current health points (HP), which can change, but not their maximum
    health points (MAX HP). In fact, a pokemonâ€™s current HP cannot be less than zero, or
    greater than its MAX HP. Similarly, EP can never be less than zero or greater than 100. When
    creating a Pokemon, its current HP and current EP are the same value as their corresponding
    maximum HP and EP. From now, we use HP to refer to the current HP and MAX HP to refer
    to the maximum health points.

    After creation, we can change the name of a pokemon but not its type or MAX HP. Also, we
    cannot set its HP and EP to a specific value. HP and EP can only be changed as a
    consequence of battling (details in Tasks below).*/
